# Limitations & Challenges Faced

1. **Limited Device Compatibility:**  
   The game may not render correctly on mobile or small screens due to lack of responsive design.

2. **No Save Progress Feature:**  
   If the player closes the browser tab, all progress is lost — there's no save or checkpoint system.

3. **Static Level Design:**  
   Currently, the game uses hardcoded puzzles. Adding dynamic or randomly generated puzzles would improve replayability but requires a more complex backend.
